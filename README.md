It's important to note that this page includes a JavaScript function that calculates Pi with an increasing number of iterations. While this may seem like a harmless background task, it can require a significant amount of CPU resources to execute, especially as the number of iterations increases.

As a result, users who visit the page and leave it open in their browser may not be aware that their computer's CPU is being used to perform this calculation in the background. Depending on the number of iterations and the user's hardware, this could potentially slow down their computer or cause other performance issues.

To address this issue, it's important to be mindful of the potential impact that background scripts can have on a user's system, and to design pages and scripts that are as efficient and lightweight as possible to minimize their impact. It's also good practice to inform users about any background scripts that are running on the page and provide options for them to control or disable them if desired.

That being said, this page still provides a simple and fun template for creating web pages with cool effects. You can download or clone this repository and customize the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code to create your own page while being mindful of the potential impact on system resources.
